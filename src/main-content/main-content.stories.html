  <h2>Main Content</h2>
  <p>
    The main content of a page must respect the positioning top and side
    navbars, including whether the side nav is expanded or not. To accomplish
    this, the styleguide provides the `omrs-main-content` css class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that it is best to use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element instead of
    a div for your main content, since that will help screen readers assist the
    user in finding the main content of the current page.
